# You can add your own logic to call an LLM to create a PPT and store it.

    Imagine we call an Azure OpenAI endpoint with the question, answer_text, and chat_history,
    create a PPT file in memory or upload it to Blob, then return a shareable link.

    For now, we just return a fake link as a placeholder.

    # You could do something like:
    # 1) Make an OpenAI call that returns slides text
    # 2) Programmatically build a PPT using python-pptx
    # 3) Upload PPT to Azure Blob
    # 4) Return the Blob link

    # For demonstration, we return a dummy link:
    return "https://fakepptlocation.com/your_ppt_file.pptx"
